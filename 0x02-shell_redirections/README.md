File 0-hello_world is a script that print "Hello, world", followed by a new line to the standard output 
File 1-Confused_smiley is a script that displays a confused smiley 
File 2-hellofile displays the content of the/ect/password file
File 3-twofiles displays the content of /ect/password and/hosts
File 4-lastline of a file
I'd prefer the first ones actually
line #2
It is a good file that cuts iron without  making a noise
